# Statistical Learning

This material is the basis for a two-semester data science methods course.

It is part of a collection of online material for teaching data science and statistics at the graduate level.
This material on statistical learning accompanies

- [Foundations of Data Science--Beyond the Numbers](https://oschabenberger.github.io/oschabenberger-github.io-bn/) (*Foundations*) and

- [Statistical Programming](https://oschabenberger.github.io/oschabenberger-github.io-sp/) (*StatProgramming*).

*Foundations* covers fundamental concepts in data science and the data science project life cycle.
*StatProgramming* is a short treatise about statistical programming and statistical program packages.

All three "books" were written in Quarto because it combines prose with math and supports multiple programming languages and kernels within the same framework. To learn more about Quarto books visit <https://quarto.org/docs/books>.
